          <h2>About It Gets Weird</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to It Gets Weird, our comedy show where we explore the
            unusual, the unbelievable, and the unexplained to try and make your
            world a little weirder. We're Nile and Kyle and we've been
            discussing the world of weird for almost a decade. We both get
            stoked about this strange stories, most of which are - let's be
            honest - also pretty funny. And so we started a podcast about it.
